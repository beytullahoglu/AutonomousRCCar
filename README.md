Autonomous RC Car for ME 384 Mechatronics course project.
Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey.
Our aim is to be build a car which can stay between white lines and react when it sees a stop-sign.
Me and my group members spent a semester to complete it.
We used Raspberry Pi 3 as our microcontroller.
Raspberry Pi camera module was used to see what is on the road.
Using HumanDrive.py, we drove our car and collected data at the time.
Afterwards, those data was processed to build a neural network in NeuralNetwork.py.
Finally, our neural network model helped our car to predict its route in AutonomousDriving.py
